EconomyCards - A Console-Based RogueLike Corporate Simulation Game
What is it?
EconomyCards is a RogueLike card game inspired by "Reigns" by Nerial. Your goal is to keep your business financially sustainable for as long as possible. Keep the money flowing and expand branches to become the most successful business in the world!

Key Features:
Manage your income and expenditure as a mana-based system.
Conquer new markets to maximize profits in a dynamic economy system based on a stock-market.
Leave your mark with an in-game highscore system.
Installation
This will be executable C++ code. Instructions for building and running the game will be provided in the future.

Development Status
Will it be finished? Not sure, this is my first attempt at a game. Recent developments? No.

Gameplay
You will probably only control the gameplay through text-based inputs. Use console commands to select/play cards, navigate the menu, and communicate with the game.

Planned Features
Cards
Evolving card deck containing cards with various impacts:

Small impact: Buffs to investment (passive), gamble a share in a different market (active).
Medium impact: Buying new machinery for your factories, layoffs, marketing.
High impact: Assassinating politicians, mass layoffs, migrating to other countries.
Cards will help you achieve different goals, such as:

Getting a second life by migrating to a country with low wages.
Accelerating to the late game by migrating to a tax haven.
Cards will be given out randomly and will cost money.

Money
Money will be realized as a reflection of income/expenditures, functioning as a classic mana system for card games.
Money will be gained through your workers' and your own efforts, passively through investments, and probably directly through played cards.
Don't go broke.
Miscellaneous
Simulated stock market to base your decisions on.
Immersive vibes and world-building.
Highscore system with in-game honors.
Contributions
Yes, please! I will decide about any changes on my own, though.

Known Bugs
Of course not. (But seriously, if you find any, let me know!)

EconomyCards - A console-based RogueLike corporate simulation game

What is it? EconomyCards is a RogueLike card game inspired by "Reigns" by Nerial. Your goal is to keep your business financially sustainable for as long as possible. Keep the money flowing and expand branches to become the most successful business in the world!

Key Features:

- Manage your income and expenditure as a mana-based system.
- Conquer new markets to maximize profits in a dynamic economy system based on a stock-market.
- Leave your mark with an in-game highscore system.

Installation? This will be executable C++ code. Instructions for building and running the game will be provided in the future.

Will it be finished? Not sure, this is my first attempt at a game.

Recent developments? No.

Gameplay? You will probably only control the gameplay through text-based inputs. Use console commands to select/play cards, navigate the menu, and communicate with the game.

Planned features:

CARDS

Evolving card deck containing cards with various impacts:
- Small impact: Buffs to investment (passive), gamble a share in a different market (active).
- Medium impact: Buying new machinery for your factories, layoffs, marketing.
- High impact: Assassinating politicians, mass layoffs, migrating to other countries.

Cards will help you achieve different goals, such as:
- Getting a second life by migrating to a country with low wages.
- Accelerating to the late game by migrating to a tax haven.

Cards will be given out randomly and will cost money.

MONEY

Money will be realized as a reflection of income/expenditures, functioning as a classic mana system for card games. Money will be gained through your workers' and your own efforts, passively through investments, and probably directly through played cards. Don't go broke.

MISC

- Simulated stock market to base your decisions on.
- Immersive vibes and world-building.
- Highscore system with in-game honors.

Progression:

As you progress in the game, your goal is to increase your income to unthinkable heights. However, be aware that the cost of cards will also increase significantly over time. In the worst-case scenario, you might find yourself unable to afford any new cards. When this happens, you'll be at the mercy of the market, relying on its fluctuations and hoping for the best.

Contributions? Yes, please! I will decide about any changes on my own, though.

Known bugs? Of course not. (But seriously, if you find any, let me know!)

Authors? Me :)
